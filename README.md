# Chessanalyze

### About
Chessanalyze is the software for http://jhaveri.net/chess.  This is a project I created to analyze my chess games using Stockfish.

### The code
To get started, have a look at analyzer/analyze.py.  There are two projects:
 - An analysis service that takes in a PGN and analyzes the game using stockfish (analyzer)
 - A website that visualizes and displays the analyzed games (web)
